description: "Run the three-phase Feature Planner validation before implementing a feature. Use when the user says plan feature, plan a new feature, I want to add, or any request for structured feature planning with edge case and risk analysis."

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent changes: !`git log --oneline -5`
- Project structure: !`ls -la`

## Your Task

You are invoking the **Feature Planner** agent workflow. Run all three validation phases for the following feature:

**Feature:** $ARGUMENTS

### Phase 1: Domain & Spec Validation

Before planning, validate the project's documentation and specs:

- **Completeness**: All key features specced? Features in README but missing from specs?
- **Gaps**: Missing specs, undocumented decisions, features without tasks
- **Consistency**: Do specs, README, and tasks tell the same story? Contradictions?
- **Staleness**: Specs outdated relative to completed work? CHANGELOG accurate?
- **Coverage**: Tasks cover all specced features? Orphaned tasks?
- **Clarity**: Requirements precise enough to implement? Vague language?
- **Data model**: Entities, relationships, invariants defined? Missing fields or constraints?
- **API contracts**: Endpoints, payloads, error responses, status codes documented?
- **Non-functional requirements**: Performance targets, scalability, availability, rate limits?

Report each item as PASS / WARN / BLOCK. Stop if any BLOCK items exist.

### Phase 2: Task Validation

For each task derived from the feature:

- **Requirements clarity**: Specific and testable? Flag vague language
- **Acceptance criteria**: Concrete, verifiable, can each become a test?
- **Scope**: Too big? Too small? Clear boundaries?
- **Edge cases**: Error states, empty states, concurrent access, boundary conditions, null inputs, permission denied, timeout/retry, race conditions
- **Dependencies**: Other tasks, services, APIs, feature flags?
- **Security implications**: Auth, user data, financial transactions?
- **Data implications**: Schema changes? Migration? Breaking changes?
- **Observability**: Logging, metrics, alerting needs?
- **Rollback strategy**: Safely revertible? Feature flag needed?
- **Domain consistency**: Aligns with specs and architecture?

Output a refined task definition for each task with all gaps filled.

### Phase 3: Implementation Plan Validation

Build and validate the implementation plan:

- **Spec-plan alignment**: Addresses all requirements and acceptance criteria?
- **Technical approach**: Simplest that meets requirements?
- **Pattern consistency**: Follows existing codebase patterns?
- **File coverage**: All files that need changes identified?
- **Implementation order**: Right order? Hidden dependencies?
- **Testing strategy**: Unit, integration, e2e coverage for critical paths?
- **Migration strategy**: DB migrations? Feature flags? Backwards compatibility?
- **Risk areas**: Complex integrations, performance, third-party limits?
- **Verification plan**: How to prove it works?

### Final Output

Produce a consolidated **Validated Feature Plan** with:
1. Validation summary (all 3 phases)
2. Warnings and accepted risks
3. Refined tasks in implementation order
4. Full implementation plan with file changes
5. Recommended agent assignments
6. Open questions needing human decision
